## Project Overview
This project analyzes road accident data for 2021 and 2022 to provide actionable insights using a visually appealing dashboard. The dashboard highlights key performance indicators (KPIs) to assist stakeholders in improving road safety and transport operations.

### Data Source
The dataset used for this analysis is the "" , a sample dataset from Kaggle.

### Key Objectives
- Determine the total casualties and their distribution by severity, vehicle type, road type, and surface condition.
- Visualize trends over time and identify relationships between location, time of day, and casualties.
- Provide stakeholders with actionable insights via an interactive dashboard.


## Dashboard Features
### **Primary KPIs**
1. Total casualties after accidents.
2. Percentage of casualties by severity.
3. Maximum casualties by vehicle type.

### **Secondary KPIs**
1. Total casualties by vehicle category.
2. Monthly trend comparison (current year vs. previous year).
3. Maximum casualties by road type.
4. Distribution of casualties by road surface.
5. Relationship between casualties by location and time of day.


## Stakeholders
- Ministry of Transport
- Road Transport Department
- Police Force
- Emergency Services Department
- Road Safety Corps
- Transport Operators
- General Public


## Files and Directories
- **Data**: Contains a sample dataset (`sample_dataset.csv`) sourced from Kaggle.
- **Scripts**: Includes detailed data cleaning steps and Excel formulas.
- **Dashboard**: Contains the dashboard file (`road_accident_dashboard.xlsx`) and screenshots of visualized KPIs.
- **Documentation**: Provides an in-depth analysis report in markdown and PDF formats.


## How to Use
1. Download the project repository.
2. Open `road_accident_dashboard.xlsx` in Excel to explore the interactive dashboard.
3. Refer to the `Documentation` folder for a detailed explanation of the analysis process.

## Tools and Techniques
- **Software**: Microsoft Excel
- **Data Cleaning**: Removal of duplicates, handling of blanks/outliers, and reclassification.
- **Visualization**: Donut charts, bar charts, line charts, and an improvised treemap.
- **Data Analysis**: Pivot tables for aggregating and summarizing insights.


## Key Insights

Here are actionable insights derived from the road accident analysis, tailored to the stakeholders:
- Cars accounted for the highest number of casualties (333,484).
- Urban areas experienced higher casualties compared to rural areas.
- Dry road surfaces conttributed to the majority of accidents, indicating the importance of behavioral factors.
- Accidents peak in specific months (as shown in the monthly trend comparison).
- Some road types (e.g., highways) show **maximum casualties**.
- **Nighttime accidents** have a significant contribution to casualties.
- Certain locations consistently show high casualties.
- Severe accidents result in **a high number of fatalities**.
- Certain vehicle types, like motorcycles and heavy goods vehicles, also show notable casualties.  
- Pedestrians and cyclists are among the most vulnerable road users.


## Recommendations

- Implement stricter vehicle inspections and driver re-certification programs targeting cars.
- Focus on improving urban traffic infrastructure, including safer pedestrian crossings and enhanced traffic signal systems.
- Introduce driver awareness campaigns on speeding, distracted driving, and maintaining safe distances.
- Schedule preventive measures such as public safety drives and stricter traffic monitoring during peak months.
- Prioritize road repair and safety measures (e.g., additional barriers, speed breakers) on high-risk roads.
- Increase patrols and sobriety checkpoints during nighttime to prevent reckless driving and drunk driving.
- Deploy targeted enforcement strategies, including speed monitoring and signage improvements, in high-risk areas.
- Improve response times by identifying accident-prone areas and deploying ambulances closer to these hotspots.
- Increase public education on safe driving practices in adverse weather and provide real-time updates on road conditions.
- Conduct regular safety training for drivers, focusing on defensive driving and handling adverse road conditions.
- Advocate for better awareness of road safety rules and increased use of safety gear (e.g., helmets, reflective clothing).
