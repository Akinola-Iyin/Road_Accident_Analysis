### Data Source
The dataset used for this analysis is a sample dataset from Kaggle; [Road_Accident_Analysis_Raw_Data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mkLFGsHRydUzInteCJwhKCM7PQBS92k8/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=118110181468829394233&rtpof=true&sd=true).

### Key Objectives
- Determine the total casualties and their distribution by severity, vehicle type, road type, and surface condition.
- Visualize trends over time and identify relationships between location, time of day, and casualties.
- Provide stakeholders with actionable insights via an interactive dashboard.


## Dashboard Features
### **Primary KPIs**
1. Total casualties after accidents.
2. Percentage of casualties by severity.
3. Maximum casualties by vehicle type.

### **Secondary KPIs**
1. Total casualties by vehicle category.
2. Monthly trend comparison (current year vs. previous year).
3. Maximum casualties by road type.
4. Distribution of casualties by road surface.
5. Relationship between casualties by location and time of day.


## Stakeholders

- Road Transport Department
- Police Force
- Emergency Services Department
- Road Safety Corps
- Transport Operators
- General Public


## Files
- **Dataset**: You can check out the Excel workbook containing the cleaned data and the interactive dashboard here: [Excel Workbook](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11BwMb3GIuYUSnVOuKBAlp5lJ9yUWWyu8/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=118110181468829394233&rtpof=true&sd=true).
- **Documentation**: The in-depth analysis report can be downloaded here: [Data_Cleaning_and_Analysis_Report.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18068672/Data_Cleaning_and_Analysis_Report.pdf)



## Tools and Techniques
- **Software**: Microsoft Excel
- **Data Cleaning**: Removal of duplicates, handling of blanks/outliers, and reclassification.
- **Visualization**: Donut charts, bar charts, line charts, and an improvised treemap.
- **Data Analysis**: Pivot tables for aggregating and summarizing insights.


## Key Insights

Here are actionable insights derived from the road accident analysis, tailored to the stakeholders:
- **Cars** accounted for the **highest number of casualties** (333,484).
- **Urban areas** experienced **higher casualties compared to rural areas**.
- **Dry road surfaces** conttributed to the **majority of accidents**.
- Accidents peak in specific months (as shown in the monthly trend comparison).
- Some road types (e.g., highways) show **maximum casualties**.
- **Nighttime accidents** have a significant contribution to casualties.
- Certain locations consistently show high casualties.
- **Slight severity accidents** result in **the highest number of casualties**.
- Certain vehicle types, like motorcycles and heavy goods vehicles, also show notable casualties.  


## Recommendations

- Implement stricter vehicle inspections and driver re-certification programs targeting car owners.
- Focus on improving urban traffic infrastructure e.g safer pedestrian crossings and enhanced traffic signal systems.
- Introduce driver awareness campaigns on speeding, distracted driving, and maintaining safe distances.
- Schedule preventive measures such as stricter traffic monitoring during peak months.
- Prioritize road repair and safety measures (e.g., additional barriers, speed breakers) on high-risk roads.
- Increase patrols and sobriety checkpoints during night time to prevent reckless driving and drunk driving.
- Deploy targeted enforcement strategies, including speed monitoring and signage improvements, in high-risk areas.
- Improve response times by identifying accident-prone areas and deploying ambulances closer to these hotspots.
- Conduct regular safety training for truck drivers and advocate for better awareness of road safety rules and increased use of safety gear (e.g., helmets, reflective clothing) for motorcyclists.
