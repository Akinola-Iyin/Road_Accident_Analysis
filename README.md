## Project Overview
This project analyzes road accident data for 2021 and 2022 to provide actionable insights using a visually appealing dashboard. The dashboard highlights key performance indicators (KPIs) to assist stakeholders in improving road safety and transport operations.

### Data Source
The dataset used for this analysis is the "" , a sample dataset from Kaggle.

### Key Objectives
- Determine the total casualties and their distribution by severity, vehicle type, road type, and surface condition.
- Visualize trends over time and identify relationships between location, time of day, and casualties.
- Provide stakeholders with actionable insights via an interactive dashboard.
